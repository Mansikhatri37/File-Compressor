File Compressor
A file compression tool using Huffman Coding that reduces the size of text files by encoding characters based on their frequencies. It supports both compression and decompression while preserving the original data integrity.

Real-World Applications
->Data Storage: Compress large text files to save disk space (e.g., logs, documents).

->Data Transmission: Reduce data size for faster transmission in networks.

->Text & Document Compression: Save space for documents, books, and legal papers.

->Backup Systems: Compress files for efficient backups. Embedded Systems: Save space in memory-constrained devices like IoT devices.

Future Scope
->Image Compression: Implement lossless and lossy image compression using Huffman coding for efficient storage and transmission of images.

->Text and Image Hybrid Compression: Extend the algorithm to handle both text and images, compressing multi-format files like scanned documents.

->Compression for Other File Types: Adapt the algorithm to compress PDFs, audio, and video files for more versatile usage.
